We were able to make all the features of Assignment 7 work through their
view using our model and controller adapters. This includes the editing
capabilities, having the input box display contents of the cell,
being able to calculate formulas, updating cells, and etc.

They also had some additional features/functions related to assignment 9
that we didn't adapt because we never added functionality for those things
for our model. This includes saving the file through the view gui directly,
creating a new one, or opening a previously saved one.

JAVA STYLE POINTS:
We lost 8 points total due to JavaStyle errors in the provider's code.
CellAttributes.java - 3
HeaderRenderer.java - 2
WorksheetCellEditor.java -1
WorksheetMenuBar.java - 2

We were told on piazza to just include it in the README to ask for the points back,
rather than changing the provider's code ourselves.
