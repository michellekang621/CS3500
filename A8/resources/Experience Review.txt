1. What do you wish you had done differently in your design/implementation?
    Did you learn any lessons from the code given to you, or the
    updates you had to make for your customers?

Something we wish we had done better earlier on is the
encapsulation of our model. Our model interface methods
were dependent on a couple classes that technically should
have been private. However, some of our methods took in these
classes as parameters or had them as return values which
forced us to have to share more classes than we would have
had we better encapsulated our model – making it more flexible
for our clients. We partly learned this through the code given
to us, which also worked with a class (Formula) that was not
originally a part of the publicly available code. This made
the implementation of their model interface (Worksheet)
difficult because we didn’t have the necessary code to
implement certain methods that worked with the Formula class.

2. What was your experience like with your providers?

We had a very pleasant experience with our providers. They
responded both quickly and promptly and gave us exactly
what we needed. They also helped us in realizing that
the group we would provide our code to wasn’t the same
group that we should receive code from. Thankfully, this
helped us bring up the issue with the course staff and get
our issue resolved before it developed into anything too
serious.
