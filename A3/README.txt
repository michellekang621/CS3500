BasicPyramidSolitaire:
I abstracted a lot of the methods to make the code look cleaner.
The abstracted methods are all not public, and are tested in the
separate BasicPyramidSolitaireTest file.

I also fixed code for bugs that weren't discovered until this assignment,
including the interaction between getDrawCards() and discardDraw() and etc.
